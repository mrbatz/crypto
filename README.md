# crypto

This is a python script of my bitcoin tracker to later be integrated with other code once improved. This file makes an infinite API call to get the price of bitcoin, uses Matplotlib to plot the graph, and Numpy to handle the arrays. The requirements to run this program can be met by navigating to the crypto folder and issuing one or two of the following commands:
 1. sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 2. pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
